## OSINT ethical principles
1. **Privacy Protection**: Even when collecting information through OSINT, it is important to adhere to privacy laws. Especially when dealing with sensitive personal information such as social security numbers, phone numbers, addresses, etc., extra care is needed.
2. **Ethical Use**: Always practice ethical use when employing OSINT. Clearly define the purpose of collecting the information and take precautions to prevent harm to others based on that information.
3. **Compliance with Service Policies**: Ensure compliance with the policies of the specific service or platform when collecting OSINT. Each platform has its own rules and policies, and failure to adhere to them may result in an account being restricted or blocked.

While collecting publicly available information itself may not pose legal issues, the responsibility lies with the user regarding the ethical use and handling of that information.
